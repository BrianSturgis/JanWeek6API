## Application Description

This is a project made up of weekly lessons at Epicodus.


## The projects objectives were to complete the following (MVP)
- the application correctly make an API call?

- the application correctly parse data from the API response?
- the application handle errors when the API call doesn't return a 200 OK status as well as return a message if the API returns no results?
- the application stores an API key correctly and provide README instructions for setting up an API key?
- the app separates logic into different JavaScript files and use a static method?
- the application correctly use webpack?
- Code and Git documentation follow best practices (setup instructions in README, .gitignore file excluding unnecessary content from repo, detailed well-formatted commit messages, etc.)
- the project demonstrates concepts covered during that week? 
- the app in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?


## Stretch Goals
- A UI for the application allowing navigation of all of the smaller lessons.


## Known Bugs
none as of yet but don't fret as there will be.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- repository location (https://github.com/BrianSturgis/JanWeek5Project)
- open through a git terminal or clone editor.
- got to repo location.
- using git commands clone to local repo
- or click "download" and unpack on machine

## USING THIS APPLICATION
- This app uses node.js. If you do not already have node.js installed, visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install.
- After installing node, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo in a as Command Prompt or Git Bash. 
- type in "npm install".
- Then type in "npm run build".

If you would like to run the program through the server, you can type "npm run start" which will build the program and launch the preview to the local server.

If you use Jest to run your tests, open your terminal and go to the root of the project directory and type in "npm test".
If you would like to run the program through the server, you can type "npm run start" which will build the program and launch the preview to the local server.

## SPECS
```JS

// create an Object to hold all relevant key values
Test: "should create an instance of Calculator"
code:calculatorObject();
Expect:(calculatorObject).toEqual(inputtedAge,0,0);


// create an array holding inputted age divided by each planets factor (loop)
Test: " should calculate 0 years into Mercury years by returning an array of the number divided by Mercury years"
code: alienAge();
Expect:(AlienAge[0]).toEqual([0]);

Test: "should calculate 0 years into Mercury years by returning an array of the number divided by Venus years"
code: alienAge();
Expect:(AlienAge[0]).toEqual([0]);

Test: "should calculate 0 years into Mercury years by returning an array of the number divided by Mars years"
code: alienAge();
Expect:(AlienAge[0]).toEqual([0]);

Test: "should calculate 0 years into Mercury years by returning an array of the number divided by Jupiter years"
code: alienAge();
Expect:(AlienAge[0]).toEqual([0]);


// should divide overage of ageCheck into planets factor (loop)
Test: "should calculate 0 years into years left to live in Mercury years"
code: lifeExpectancy();
Expect:().toEqual();

Test: "should calculate 0 years into years left to live in Venus years"
code: lifeExpectancy();
Expect:().toEqual();

Test: "should calculate 0 years into years left to live in Mars years"
code: lifeExpectancy();
Expect:().toEqual();

Test: "should calculate 0 years into years left to live in Jupiter years"
code: lifeExpectancy();

// should check whether age is over under 73  (branch or switch)
Test: "should determine whether inputtedAge is under 73"
code: ageCheck();
Expect:().toEqual();

Test: "should determine whether inputtedAge is over 73"
code: ageCheck();
